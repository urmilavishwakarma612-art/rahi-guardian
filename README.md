**RAHI** is a smart emergency-response web platform designed to help people facing accidents, injuries, medical issues, or vehicle breakdowns on highways.  
It connects **victims → nearby helpers → official emergency services** in real-time.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Highways in India are unsafe during emergencies due to:

- Slow response time for help
- Lack of exact location communication
- No unified platform for instant reporting
- Bystanders unable to help efficiently
- Delay in alerting nearest authority/ambulance

This often leads to preventable loss of lives.
